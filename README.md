# Othello
Try out the game here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aditya-kukreja/Othello/blob/main/othello/index.html
Othello is a famous 2 player strategy board game which is a variation to the board game Reversi. You can check out the rules here: https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english. This project is themed around the implementation of the minimax AI algorithm for the opponent. I created the GUI using CSS and used functional programming in javascript for the logic and AI. To improve upon the AI, I increased the weights of corner moves and edge moves(except the edge moves that could lead to the opponent capturing the corner, for which i gave a negative weight).
